Flight Control Unit
**********************

The flight control unit must process the information of some sensors (IMUs, barometers, etc) and process some algorithm.
And with the output of this algorithm will control the motors to make the drone stable.

There are COTs FCU in the market, for example the Pixhawk 6X is a powerful one that uses a Cortex M7 to process the data of the sensors.
